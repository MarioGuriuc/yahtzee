# Yahtzee
This project implements a digital version of the classic Yahtzee dice game. The game is designed using state-based programming, ensuring a clear separation of game states (e.g., rolling dice, selecting categories, scoring) for better maintainability and readability.

The AI opponent is modeled as a search problem, allowing it to make intelligent decisions based on possible future game outcomes, optimizing its chances of success.
